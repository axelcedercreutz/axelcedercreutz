From the competitive world of sports to the dynamic realm of tech, I've seamlessly transitioned my passion for performance and precision into my professional career. As an ex-athlete, I bring discipline, teamwork, and strategic thinking to the table, qualities that have propelled my success in software development, data engineering, and product management.
